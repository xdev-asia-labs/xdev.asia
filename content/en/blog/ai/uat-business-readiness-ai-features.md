excerpt: >-
  UAT for AI features isn't like traditional UAT — you test not just business logic but AI output quality, edge cases, bias, and whether users actually trust the AI. Complete guide from UAT plan, business readiness checklist to go/no-go decision framework for BA.

UAT is the final test round BA and business stakeholders run before release. With traditional features, pass/fail is clear. With AI features, it's more complex: AI might *technically* work but *business* still isn't ready to accept it.

---

## 1. Why UAT for AI is Different

| Aspect | Traditional Feature | AI Feature |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Test case | Input X → Output Y fixed | Input X → Output Y variable |
| Pass/Fail | Binary | Can be "acceptable range" |
| Edge cases | Finite, list them all | Nearly infinite |
| Bias testing | Not needed | Essential |
| User trust | Less relevant | Critical — does user trust AI? |
| Rollback | Code revert | May need model version rollback |

---

## 2. Three Tiers of UAT for AI Feature

### Tier 1: Functional UAT (traditional)

Test core business flows:
- Happy paths per acceptance criteria
- Error handling for invalid input
- Integration with other systems

### Tier 2: AI Output Quality UAT

Test AI output quality in business context:
- **Accuracy**: How accurate is output on test set?
- **Relevance**: Answers address context correctly?
- **Hallucination check**: Is AI making things up?
- **Tone & format**: Does output match brand/policy?

**How:** BA + domain expert prepare **Golden Test Set** — 50–100 sample inputs with expected outputs. Run AI on this set and score.

```
Golden Test Set template:
| Test ID | Input | Expected | Actual | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| TC-001  | "What is interest rate..." | "Current rate is..." | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Tier 3: Business Readiness UAT

Test organizational readiness (not just system):
- Have users been trained?
- Does helpdesk/agent know how to handle AI mistakes?
- Is rollback procedure ready?
- Is monitoring dashboard live?

## 3. UAT Plan Template for AI Feature

```markdown
# UAT PLAN: [Feature Name]

## 1. Scope & Objectives
- Feature: [description]
- UAT period: [start → end date]
- Environment: [UAT env URL, dataset]
- Objectives: Verify [list business objectives]

## 2. Participants
| Role | Person | Responsibility |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| UAT Lead (BA) | ... | Plan, coordinate, sign-off |
| Business Tester | ... | Execute test cases |
| Domain Expert | ... | Evaluate AI output quality |
| Product Owner | ... | Go/no-go decision |

## 3. Test Scenarios

### Group A: Functional (must-pass)
- [TC-F-001] Happy path: [description]
- [TC-F-002] Error path: [description]

### Group B: AI Quality (acceptance threshold)
- [TC-AI-001] Accuracy on golden test set ≥ [N]%
- [TC-AI-002] Hallucination rate ≤ [M]% on test set
- [TC-AI-003] Escalation trigger correct when confidence < threshold

### Group C: Business Readiness (must complete)
- [TC-BR-001] Training materials reviewed by [team]
- [TC-BR-002] Rollback procedure tested
- [TC-BR-003] Monitoring alerts configured

## 4. Entry/Exit Criteria
**Entry (UAT can start when):**
☐ Build deployed on UAT env
☐ QA signed off on SIT
☐ Test data prepared

**Exit (UAT completes when):**
☐ 100% Group A scenarios passed
☐ Group B accuracy ≥ threshold
☐ 0 Critical defects open
☐ Business stakeholder signed off
```

## 4. Go/No-Go Decision Framework

BA consolidates UAT results and proposes go/no-go:

| Category | Criteria | Status | Weight |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Blocker** | 0 critical defects | ✅/❌ | Must pass |
| **Blocker** | Accuracy ≥ threshold | ✅/❌ | Must pass |
| **Blocker** | Human override working | ✅/❌ | Must pass |
| **Important** | All happy paths pass | ✅/❌ | High |
| **Important** | Business tester sign-off | ✅/❌ | High |
| **Nice-to-have** | All edge cases pass | ✅/❌ | Medium |
| **Nice-to-have** | Performance within SLA | ✅/❌ | Medium |

**Decision rule:**
- ✅ All Blockers → **GO**
- ❌ Any Blocker → **NO-GO** (fix and re-test)
- GO with Important defects → **GO with known issues** (communicate clearly)

---

## 5. Business Readiness Checklist

Before launch, BA verifies:

```
USER TRAINING
☐ User guide / FAQ written and reviewed
☐ Training session scheduled
☐ Sandbox/demo env available for users
☐ Change management email drafted

SUPPORT READINESS
☐ Helpdesk/Agent trained that AI can fail and how to handle
☐ Escalation path AI → agent → supervisor clear
☐ FAQ about AI limitations ready for support team
☐ Known limitations document shared

TECHNICAL READINESS
☐ Monitoring dashboard live and tested
☐ Alerting rules set (accuracy drop, error rate spike)
☐ Rollback procedure documented and tested
☐ On-call schedule for launch day

COMMUNICATION
☐ Launch announcement drafted and approved
☐ Internal stakeholders notified [N] days pre-launch
☐ External communication (if any) approved
```

## 6. Rollout Strategy for AI Feature

Launching 100% immediately is risky. Common strategies:

| Strategy | When | Risk |
|----------|------|------|
| **Full launch** | Low risk, high confidence | Highest |
| **Canary** (5% → 20% → 100%) | Medium risk, need monitoring | Lower, catch early issues |
| **A/B test** | Want to measure business impact | Requires large sample |
| **Shadow mode** | AI runs behind scenes, humans decide | Zero user impact, data collection |

---

## Summary

Good UAT for AI = Functional test + AI quality test + Business readiness. BA connects all three, not just runs test cases.

Key mindset shift: **Acceptance threshold, not absolute pass/fail**. 85% AI accuracy might be "good enough" — but stakeholders must agree before, not after results.
