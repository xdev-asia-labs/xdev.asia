## 1. Overview: How AI Is Reshaping Healthcare

Global healthcare faces a paradox: an aging population, increasingly complex diseases, and a specialist physician supply that cannot keep pace. In the United States, an estimated shortage of **124,000 physicians** is projected by 2034. In Vietnam, the physician-to-10,000-population ratio is approximately 9 — far below the WHO's recommended 25.

AI does not replace physicians — AI is a **capability amplifier** for physicians.

### 1.1. Market Scale

| Year | Global AI in Healthcare Market Size |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| 2023 | $19.27 billion USD |
| 2024 | $26.69 billion USD |
| 2026 | ~$45 billion USD |
| 2030 | $187.95 billion USD |

CAGR ~38.5%/year — one of the highest growth rates in the technology sector.

## 2. Medical Imaging AI

### 2.1. Why Medical Imaging Is the "Golden Problem" for Deep Learning

Medical images have characteristics ideal for CNNs:

- **Unstructured data requiring pattern recognition** — deep learning's core strength
- **Large volume**: A 500-bed hospital generates ~50 GB of DICOM images per day
- **Relatively clear ground truth**: Histopathology results and surgery provide definitive labels
- **Measurable expert error rates**: ~4% of chest X-rays are misread; 28% of skin cancers are initially misdiagnosed

### 2.2. CNN Architectures for Medical Imaging

**ResNet / DenseNet** are the most common backbones in medical imaging because:
- Skip connections address vanishing gradients in deep networks
- DenseNet with feature reuse performs especially well with limited data

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

class ChestXRayClassifier(nn.Module):
    """
    Chest X-ray classification model for 14 pathologies
    (pneumonia, pleural effusion, atelectasis, etc.)
    """
    def __init__(self, num_classes=14, pretrained=True):
        super().__init__()
        # Transfer learning from ImageNet — reduces required data by 80%
        self.backbone = models.densenet121(pretrained=pretrained)

        # Replace the final classifier
        in_features = self.backbone.classifier.in_features
        self.backbone.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Dropout(p=0.5),
            nn.Linear(in_features, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(p=0.3),
            nn.Linear(512, num_classes),
            nn.Sigmoid()  # Multi-label: patient may have multiple conditions simultaneously
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.backbone(x)

# Loss function for multi-label classification
# Weighted BCELoss handles class imbalance (rare Hernia vs common No Finding)
class WeightedBCELoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pos_weights):
        super().__init__()
        self.pos_weights = pos_weights

    def forward(self, pred, target):
        return nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy(
            pred, target,
            weight=self.pos_weights.unsqueeze(0).expand_as(target)
        )
```

**Data augmentation** is particularly important because medical datasets are always small and imbalanced:

```python
from torchvision import transforms
import albumentations as A
from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2

# Augmentation must be "medically reasonable" — do NOT flip chest X-rays vertically!
train_transform = A.Compose([
    A.RandomRotate90(p=0.0),        # NO 90° rotation (heart does not sit on the right)
    A.Rotate(limit=10, p=0.5),      # Only small ±10° rotations
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),        # OK: horizontal flip for chest
    A.RandomBrightness(limit=0.2),
    A.RandomContrast(limit=0.2),
    A.GaussNoise(var_limit=(0, 25)),
    A.Resize(224, 224),
    A.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],  # ImageNet mean (grayscale → 3 channels)
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    ),
    ToTensorV2()
])
```

### 2.3. Real-World Results of AI Medical Imaging

| Application | Model | AUC | vs. Physicians |
|-------------|-------|-----|----------------|
| Chest X-ray (14 pathologies) | CheXNet (Stanford) | 0.90 | Outperforms 4 radiologists |
| Skin cancer (melanoma) | Google Inception | 0.991 | Equivalent to 21 dermatologists |
| Diabetic retinopathy | DeepMind | 0.997 | Equivalent to specialists |
| Colon polyps (colonoscopy) | GI Genius | +14% detection | Augments, doesn't replace |
| Brain MRI reading | AI Radiology | ~95% acc | 40× faster |

### 2.4. Segmentation — Tumor Boundary Delineation

Detecting tumors is only the first step. Segmentation (precisely delineating boundaries) is essential for radiation therapy and surgery:

```python
# U-Net — the gold standard architecture for medical image segmentation
class UNet(nn.Module):
    """
    U-Net with skip connections for tumor segmentation
    Input: 512x512 CT image, Output: 512x512 mask (0=background, 1=tumor)
    """
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=1, features=[64, 128, 256, 512]):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.ModuleList()
        self.decoder = nn.ModuleList()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)

        # Encoder (Contracting path)
        for feature in features:
            self.encoder.append(self._double_conv(in_channels, feature))
            in_channels = feature

        # Bottleneck
        self.bottleneck = self._double_conv(features[-1], features[-1] * 2)

        # Decoder (Expansive path) with skip connections
        for feature in reversed(features):
            self.decoder.append(
                nn.ConvTranspose2d(feature * 2, feature, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
            )
            self.decoder.append(self._double_conv(feature * 2, feature))

        self.final_conv = nn.Conv2d(features[0], out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def _double_conv(self, in_ch, out_ch):
        return nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, 3, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(out_ch),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(out_ch, out_ch, 3, padding=1, bias=False),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(out_ch),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
        )
```

> **Metric**: Dice Coefficient is the standard metric for medical segmentation (a spatially-aware F1 score). Dice ≥ 0.85 is the accepted clinical threshold for tumor segmentation.

## 3. AI and Electronic Health Records (EHR / EMR)

### 3.1. NLP for Extracting Information from Medical Text

90% of clinical information lives in **unstructured text** — physician notes, narrative lab results, discharge summaries. NLP transforms this text into structured data:

```python
import spacy
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
import torch

# BioBERT / ClinicalBERT — BERT pretrained on PubMed + MIMIC-III
# Understands medical terminology 40–60% better than standard BERT
model_name = "dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    num_labels=9  # B/I/O for: DISEASE, DRUG, DOSAGE, SYMPTOM
)

def extract_medical_entities(clinical_note: str) -> dict:
    """
    Extracts: diseases, drugs, dosages, symptoms from clinical notes
    
    Input: "Patient with hypertension, on Amlodipine 5mg/day, 
            complaining of headache and dizziness."
    Output: {
        "diseases": ["hypertension"],
        "drugs": ["Amlodipine"],
        "dosages": ["5mg/day"],
        "symptoms": ["headache", "dizziness"]
    }
    """
    inputs = tokenizer(
        clinical_note,
        return_tensors="pt",
        truncation=True,
        max_length=512
    )

    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)

    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=2)
    tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs["input_ids"][0])

    # Merge subword tokens and extract entities
    entities = {"diseases": [], "drugs": [], "dosages": [], "symptoms": []}
    # ... (NER post-processing logic)

    return entities
```

### 3.2. 30-Day Readmission Prediction

30-day readmissions are an important hospital quality indicator. AI predicts which patients are at high risk for proactive intervention:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
import xgboost as xgb

# Feature engineering from EHR
def create_readmission_features(patient_df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    features = pd.DataFrame()

    # Demographic features
    features["age"] = patient_df["age"]
    features["age_squared"] = patient_df["age"] ** 2  # Non-linear age effect

    # Clinical severity
    features["num_diagnoses"] = patient_df["diagnoses"].apply(len)
    features["num_procedures"] = patient_df["procedures"].apply(len)
    features["icu_days"] = patient_df["icu_stay_days"]
    features["los_days"] = patient_df["length_of_stay"]

    # Lab values (trend matters more than absolute values)
    features["hba1c_latest"] = patient_df["hba1c"].apply(lambda x: x[-1] if x else None)
    features["hba1c_trend"] = patient_df["hba1c"].apply(
        lambda x: (x[-1] - x[-2]) if len(x) >= 2 else 0
    )

    # Social determinants of health (SDOH) — increasingly important
    features["insurance_type"] = patient_df["insurance"].map({
        "Medicare": 2, "Medicaid": 3, "Private": 0, "Uninsured": 4
    })
    features["discharge_to_home"] = (patient_df["discharge_destination"] == "Home").astype(int)

    # Prior utilization
    features["prior_admissions_1yr"] = patient_df["admissions_12m"]
    features["prior_er_visits"] = patient_df["er_visits_12m"]

    return features

# Ensemble model
readmission_model = Pipeline([
    ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
    ("xgb", xgb.XGBClassifier(
        n_estimators=500,
        max_depth=6,
        learning_rate=0.05,
        subsample=0.8,
        colsample_bytree=0.8,
        scale_pos_weight=3,  # Handle class imbalance (10-20% readmitted)
        eval_metric="aucpr",
        random_state=42
    ))
])
```

**Real-world results**: UCSF deployed a similar model, reducing 30-day readmission rates by 30% for cardiac patients — saving ~$4,500 per patient.

### 3.3. Early Sepsis Detection

Sepsis kills 270,000 Americans per year. Detecting it 1 hour earlier increases survival rates by 7%:

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict

# LSTM for time-series vitals analysis
import torch.nn as nn

class SepsisEarlyWarning(nn.Module):
    """
    LSTM model analyzing real-time vital sign sequences
    Inputs each hour: HR, BP (sys/dia), Temp, RR, SpO2, WBC, Lactate, Creatinine
    Output: probability of sepsis in the next 6 hours
    """
    def __init__(self, input_size=8, hidden_size=128, num_layers=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
            input_size=input_size,
            hidden_size=hidden_size,
            num_layers=num_layers,
            batch_first=True,
            dropout=0.3,
            bidirectional=False  # Causal: only uses past data
        )
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=hidden_size,
            num_heads=8,
            dropout=0.1
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.3),
            nn.Linear(64, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        # x: [batch, time_steps, features]
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)

        # Attention to focus on the most important time steps
        attn_out, _ = self.attention(
            lstm_out.transpose(0, 1),
            lstm_out.transpose(0, 1),
            lstm_out.transpose(0, 1),
            key_padding_mask=mask
        )

        # Use the final output
        output = self.classifier(attn_out[-1])
        return output
```

The **Epic Sepsis Model** (deployed in 170+ US hospitals) achieves AUC ~0.76, detecting sepsis 9–12 hours in advance.

## 4. AI in Drug Discovery

### 4.1. The Problem: Enormous Cost and Time

Traditional drug development pipeline:

```
Target ID → Hit Discovery → Lead Optimization → 
Preclinical → Phase I → Phase II → Phase III → FDA Approval

Timeline: 12–15 years
Cost: $1.3–2.6 billion USD
Success rate: ~0.01% (1/10,000 compounds)
```

AI compresses the early stages from 4–6 years down to 12–18 months.

### 4.2. AlphaFold 2 — The Protein Folding Revolution

The **protein folding problem** has existed for 50 years: given an amino acid sequence → predict the 3D structure.

3D structure determines protein function and drug molecule binding ability.

```python
# Using AlphaFold2 via ColabFold
from colabfold.batch import get_queries, run

# Target protein sequence (example: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein)
sequence = """
MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPPAYTNSFTRGVYYPDKVFRSSVLHSTQDLFLPFFSNVTWFHAIHVSGTNG
TKRFDNPVLPFNDGVYFASTEKSNIIRGWIFGTTLDSKTQSLLIVNNATNVVIKVCEFQFCNDPFLGVYYHKNNK
SWMESEFRVYSSANNCTFEYVSQPFLMDLEGKQGNFKNLREFVFKNIDGYFKIYSKHTPINLVRDLPQGFSALEP
"""

queries = [("SARSCoV2_Spike", sequence, None)]

results = run(
    queries=queries,
    result_dir="./alphafold_results",
    use_templates=False,
    num_recycles=3,          # Number of recycling steps to improve accuracy
    model_type="alphafold2_ptm",
    num_models=5
)

# Output: PDB file with 3D coordinates + per-residue confidence (pLDDT score)
# pLDDT > 90: very high confidence — suitable for drug design
```

AlphaFold 2 predicts structure with **median TM-score 0.92** — nearly matching experimental X-ray crystallography, but **100,000 times faster**.

### 4.3. Generative AI for Novel Drug Molecule Design

After obtaining the target structure, the next step is generating drug molecules that can bind to the target:

```python
import torch
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem, Descriptors

# Graph Neural Network for molecule representation
# Atoms = nodes, Bonds = edges
class MoleculeGNN(nn.Module):
    """
    Predicts drug-target binding affinity (pIC50)
    Combining molecular graph + protein pocket fingerprint
    """
    def __init__(self, atom_features=74, bond_features=12, hidden_dim=256):
        super().__init__()
        # Message Passing Neural Network
        self.conv1 = nn.Linear(atom_features, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv3 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)

        # Protein binding site encoder
        self.protein_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(1000, 512),  # Protein sequence features
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 256)
        )

        # Binding affinity predictor
        self.predictor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim + 256, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.2),
            nn.Linear(512, 1)  # Predict pIC50
        )

    def forward(self, molecule_graph, protein_features):
        # Graph convolution to learn molecular representation
        mol_repr = self.graph_conv(molecule_graph)

        # Protein binding site representation
        protein_repr = self.protein_encoder(protein_features)

        # Combine and predict
        combined = torch.cat([mol_repr, protein_repr], dim=-1)
        return self.predictor(combined)

# Goal-directed molecule design
# Uses Reinforcement Learning: simultaneously optimize multiple objectives
def multi_objective_drug_design():
    """
    Simultaneously optimize:
    - High binding affinity to target protein
    - Good ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity)
    - Drug-likeness (Lipinski's Rule of Five)
    - Synthesizability (ease of lab synthesis)
    """
    objectives = {
        "binding_affinity": lambda mol: predict_binding(mol),   # Maximize
        "toxicity": lambda mol: predict_toxicity(mol),           # Minimize
        "solubility": lambda mol: predict_logS(mol),             # Optimize

        "drug_likeness": lambda mol: QEDscore(mol),              # Maximize
    }
    return objectives
```

### 4.4. Case Study: Insilico Medicine

- **2019**: Insilico Medicine uses AI to design INS018_055 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)
- **2021**: Enters Phase I clinical trial after just **18 months** from initiation
- **2023**: Phase II shows promising results — this is the first drug designed 99% by AI to enter clinical trials

Compare to the typical 4–6 years for the equivalent stage.

## 5. Genomics and Precision Medicine

### 5.1. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Disease

Each person's DNA differs at ~3 million positions (SNPs). Certain SNPs are directly associated with:
- **Disease risk**: BRCA1/2 mutation → 70–80% breast cancer risk
- **Drug response**: CYP2C19 variant → affects Clopidogrel metabolism
- **Optimal dosage**: VKORC1 variant → determines safe Warfarin dose

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV

## 6. NLP in Healthcare: From Text to Knowledge

### 6.1. A Comprehensive Clinical NLP Pipeline

```
Raw Clinical Text
        ↓
Sentence Segmentation (More complex than standard NLP: 
  "pt c/o SOB, DOE x 3d. PMH: HTN, DM2." — specialized abbreviations!)
        ↓
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  → Diseases (UMLS codes)
  → Medications (RxNorm codes)
  → Procedures (CPT/ICD codes)
  → Lab Values + units
  → Anatomy (body parts)
        ↓
Relation Extraction
  → Drug-Disease (treatment, contraindication)
  → Drug-Drug Interaction
  → Finding-Anatomy
        ↓
Temporal Reasoning
  → Timeline of events (onset, duration, resolution)
  → Disease progression
        ↓
Structured Knowledge Graph
```

### 6.2. Medical Question Answering with LLMs

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

MEDICAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a medical assistant supporting physicians with information retrieval.

IMPORTANT:
- Only answer based on evidence-based medicine (RCTs, systematic reviews, clinical guidelines)
- Always cite sources (UpToDate, PubMed, ACC/AHA guidelines...)
- Clearly distinguish "Evidence Grade A/B/C" per ACC/AHA grading
- DO NOT diagnose specific patients directly
- When uncertain, say "I'm not certain" and recommend consulting a specialist

Physicians use this tool for: consulting guidelines, calculating clinical scores (CHADS2, 
Wells score...), drug interactions, treatment protocols."""

def clinical_decision_support(
    clinical_question: str,
    patient_context: str = None
) -> str:
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": MEDICAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT}
    ]

    if patient_context:
        messages.append({
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Clinical context: {patient_context}\n\nQuestion: {clinical_question}"
        })
    else:
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": clinical_question})

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0.1,   # Low to avoid hallucination — critically important in healthcare
        max_tokens=2000
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Example usage
answer = clinical_decision_support(
    clinical_question="Anticoagulation protocol for non-valvular atrial fibrillation?",
    patient_context="68-year-old male, CrCl 45 mL/min, HAS-BLED score 2, CHADS2-VASc score 4"
)
```

**Important note about LLMs in healthcare**: GPT-4 achieves 90%+ on USMLE Steps 1–3, but can still "hallucinate" medical information. Any clinical application requires **human-in-the-loop** and rigorous validation.

## 7. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)

### 7.1. RPM System Architecture

```
IoT Wearables (Apple Watch, CGM, Smart Patch)
        ↓ (BLE/WiFi)
Edge Processing (Phone/Hub)  ← AI: denoising, arrhythmia detection
        ↓ (HTTPS/MQTT)
Cloud Ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis)

```

### 7.2. AFib Detection from PPG

Traditionally, an **ECG with 12 leads** is needed to diagnose AFib. AI can detect AFib from **PPG (photoplethysmography)** — the heart rate sensor on a smartwatch:

        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(128 * 32, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),

        features = features.permute(0, 2, 1)
        attended = self.transformer(features)
        flat = attended.reshape(attended.size(0), -1)
        return self.classifier(flat)

def preprocess_ppg(raw_ppg: np.ndarray, fs: int = 100) -> np.ndarray:
    """Bandpass filter: retain 0.5–4 Hz (heart rate 30–240 bpm)"""

## 8. Robotic Surgery and AI Assistance

### 8.1. Robotic Surgery Systems

**da Vinci Surgical System** (Intuitive Surgical) — the most widely deployed surgical robot:
- >7 million surgeries since 1999
- Used for prostate, gynecology, cardiac, colorectal procedures
- AI integration: tremor filtering, force feedback, motion scaling

**Latest trends**:
| System | Company | AI Feature |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| da Vinci 5 | Intuitive | Force feedback, tissue tracking |
| Hugo RAS | Medtronic | Cloud-connected, performance data |
| Versius | CMR Surgical | Compact, modular |
| Mako | Stryker | Pre-op planning, real-time guidance |
| TouchSurgery | J&J | Surgical simulation + coaching AI |

### 8.2. Surgical Phase Recognition

AI monitors surgical video to identify the current phase, supporting coaching and error detection:

```python
# Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) has 7 standard phases
CHOLEC_PHASES = [
    "Preparation", "CalotTriangleDissection",
    "ClippingCutting", "GallbladderDissection",

## 9. Technical Challenges and Ethical Issues

### 9.1. Data Challenges

**Medical data is "gold data" but extremely difficult to obtain**:

| Challenge | Specific Issue | Solution |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Privacy** | HIPAA (US), GDPR (EU), Decree 13/2023 (VN) | De-identification, Federated Learning |
| **Class Imbalance** | Rare diseases: 1:1,000, even 1:100,000 | Oversampling (SMOTE), cost-sensitive learning, one-shot learning |
| **Label Noise** | Different doctors read X-rays differently | Inter-rater reliability, soft labels |
| **Distribution Shift** | Model trained in US → deployed in VN differs | Domain adaptation, regular retraining |
| **Small Dataset** | Rare diseases may have only a few hundred cases | Transfer learning, data augmentation, synthetic data (GAN) |
| **Multimodal** | Combining images + text + structured data | Multimodal fusion architectures |

**Federated Learning** — a privacy-preserving training solution:

```python
"""
Federated Learning: each hospital trains a local model,
sends gradients (not data) to a central server for aggregation.
Patient data never leaves the hospital.
"""

# FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017)
def federated_averaging(
    global_model_weights: dict,
    client_updates: list[dict],
    client_sample_counts: list[int]
) -> dict:
    """
    Weighted average of client model updates
    Weight = number of samples per client
    """
    total_samples = sum(client_sample_counts)
    avg_weights = {}

    for key in global_model_weights.keys():
        # Weighted average
        avg_weights[key] = sum(
            client_update[key] * (n / total_samples)
            for client_update, n in zip(client_updates, client_sample_counts)
        )

    return avg_weights
```

### 9.2. Bias in Healthcare AI

**Bias is a more serious issue in healthcare because it directly affects health outcomes**:

- **Pulse oximeter bias**: Devices are 3× less accurate for Black patients — leading to under-treatment of O2 during COVID-19
- **Dermatology AI**: CheXNet trained primarily on lighter skin tones → less accurate for Black/Brown skin
- **Pain Assessment AI**: NIH Pain Consortium found AI underestimates pain in women
- **Risk Score bias**: OPTUM Sepsis model performs 4.5% worse for Black patients

```python
# Fairness metrics to measure in medical AI

from fairlearn.metrics import (
    demographic_parity_difference,
    equalized_odds_difference,
    MetricFrame
)
import pandas as pd

        # FNR is important in healthcare: missing disease is more dangerous than false alarms
    }

    mf = MetricFrame(
        metrics=metrics,

    print(f"Equalized Odds Difference: {equalized_odds_difference(true_labels, model_predictions, sensitive_features=sensitive_attributes['race']):.4f}")

    return mf
```

### 9.3. Explainability in Medical AI

**The Black Box Problem**: Physicians cannot accept unexplained decisions — **"AI says the patient has cancer, but why?"**

```python
import shap
import numpy as np

# SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) — explains local predictions

def explain_readmission_prediction(
    model,
    patient_features: pd.DataFrame,
    feature_names: list

    - No family caregiver at home (+0.12)
    - Age 78 (+0.09)"
    """
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(patient_features)

    # Waterfall plot for each specific patient

        shap.Explanation(
            values=shap_values[0],

    # Weighted combination of activation maps
    cam = np.zeros(activation.shape[2:], dtype=np.float32)
    for k, w in enumerate(weights[0]):
        cam += w * activation[0, k]

    cam = np.maximum(cam, 0)  # ReLU
    cam = (cam - cam.min()) / (cam.max() - cam.min())

    return cam
```

### 9.4. Regulatory Framework

| Region | Regulation | AI Medical Device Requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **USA** | FDA 510(k) / De Novo / PMA | Software as Medical Device (SaMD) classification, clinical validation |
| **EU** | EU AI Act + MDR 2017/745 | High-risk AI: conformity assessment, CE marking, post-market surveillance |
| **Vietnam** | Decree 98/2021 + Circular 46/2017 | Medical device classification A/B/C/D, Ministry of Health registration |

**FDA Pre-Determined Change Control Plan (PCCP)**: Allows AI to self-improve within approved limits without requiring resubmission — important because AI models need continuous updates.

## 10. AI in Healthcare in Vietnam

### 10.1. Current Landscape

**Challenges unique to Vietnam**:
- Public hospital system lacks digitization: <30% of provincial hospitals have complete HIS
- Fragmented, non-standardized data: each hospital uses different software
- Lack of labeled Vietnamese medical NLP data
- Healthcare workers lack digital skills

**Strengths**:
- Young population, high smartphone penetration (>70%)
- Low healthcare costs → high AI ROI
- Major hospitals (Bach Mai, Cho Ray) have enormous patient volumes → abundant data

## 11. Foundation Models and the Future of Medical AI

### 11.1. Medical Foundation Models

The new generation: instead of training many specialized models, train **one large model** pretrained on all medical data, then fine-tune for each task:

| Model | Organization | Modality | Scale |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Med-PaLM 2** | Google | Text (medical Q&A) | 540B params, USMLE 86.5% |
| **GPT-4V for Radiology** | OpenAI | Image + Text | GPT-4 base |
| **BioMedLM** | Stanford | Text (biomedicine) | 2.7B params, open-source |
| **CheXagent** | Stanford | Chest X-ray + Text | Foundation model for radiology |
| **Segment Anything Medical (SAM-Med)** | Meta-based | Universal segmentation | Zero-shot medical segmentation |
| **UniMedI** | Research | Unified medical imaging | CT/MRI/X-ray in one model |

### 11.2. Multimodal Medical AI

### 11.3. Digital Twins in Healthcare

**Patient digital twins** — digital physiological simulations of a specific patient's body:

- **Cardiac simulation**: Predicting intervention outcomes before surgery
- **Personalized pharmacodynamics**: Simulating drug metabolism with a specific patient's pharmacokinetic parameters
- **Tumor virtual biopsy**: Simulating tumor response to chemotherapy from imaging data

Dassault Systèmes and Siemens Healthineers are deploying this at pilot scale. Horizon 2030.
