BABOK (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge) is the standard reference published by IIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis) - equivalent to PMBOK for Project Managers or SWEBOK for Software Engineers. If you want to practice BA professionally, BABOK is the foundation you **must** understand.

## What is BABOK?

BABOK Guide (currently version 3.0) defines:

- **Business Analysis**: a set of activities used to identify needs and recommend solutions that create value for stakeholders
- **6 Knowledge Areas** (KA): the core knowledge groups of BA
- **50+ techniques**: specific tools and methods to perform each BA task

> BABOK is not a framework or a process - it is a **body of knowledge**, meaning a consolidated set of knowledge. You can apply BABOK in any methodology: Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid.

## The 6 Knowledge Areas in BABOK

### 1. Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring
Planning the full BA effort:
- Identify stakeholders and how to engage them
- Choose the right methodology (Agile/plan-driven)
- Define governance for BA activities
- Track progress and adjust the plan

**In AI projects**: You need additional planning for data discovery, the model evaluation cycle, and AI-specific risk assessment.

### 2. Elicitation & Collaboration
Gathering information and collaborating to understand needs:
- Interviews, workshops, surveys
- Observation, prototyping, document analysis
- Focus groups, brainstorming

**In AI projects**: AI note-taking tools and AI interview summarizers help BA process outputs 3-4x faster.

### 3. Requirements Life Cycle Management
Managing the full lifecycle of requirements:
- Trace requirements from business need -> solution
- Maintain and prioritize the requirements backlog
- Assess impacts when requirements change
- Approve and baseline requirements

**In AI projects**: You also need traceability from business requirement -> AI capability requirement -> training data requirement -> evaluation metric.

### 4. Strategy Analysis
Analyzing strategy to define the right solution:
- Analyze current state (AS-IS)
- Define future state (TO-BE)
- Assess risks and feasibility
- Define change strategy

**In AI projects**: AI readiness assessment, build vs buy vs partner decisions, and data infrastructure gap analysis all matter.

### 5. Requirements Analysis & Design Definition (RADD)
Analyzing and designing detailed requirements:
- Model requirements (UML, BPMN, use cases)
- Verify and validate requirements
- Define acceptance criteria
- Prototype and mock up solutions

**In AI projects**: Add AI behavior specifications - expected outputs, edge cases, confidence thresholds, and fallback scenarios.

### 6. Solution Evaluation
Evaluating the solution after implementation:
- Measure solution performance
- Analyze performance gaps
- Assess solution limitations
- Recommend improvements

**In AI projects**: This includes tracking AI feature adoption, monitoring model drift, and measuring delivered business value.

## Underlying Competencies

In addition to the 6 KA, BABOK defines the competencies every BA needs:

| Group | Example |
|------|-------|
| **Analytical Thinking** | Problem decomposition, decision making, systems thinking |
| **Behavioral Characteristics** | Ethics, personal accountability, trustworthiness |
| **Business Knowledge** | Business principles, industry knowledge |
| **Communication Skills** | Oral, written, facilitation, negotiation |
| **Interaction Skills** | Facilitation, leadership, teamwork |
| **Tools & Technology** | Office tools, modeling tools, requirement management tools |

## BABOK Techniques (50+ techniques)

These are the most practical techniques for BA working on AI projects:

### Elicitation
| Technique | When to use it |
|----------|-------------|
| **Structured Interviews** | Elicit needs from key stakeholders |
| **Workshops** | Align multiple stakeholders at the same time |
| **Observation (Job Shadowing)** | Understand the real user workflow |
| **Prototyping** | Validate AI UX early before building |
| **Survey/Questionnaire** | Collect data from many people |

### Analysis
| Technique | When to use it |
|----------|-------------|
| **Business Rules Analysis** | Define business logic for AI |
| **Decision Analysis** | Build decision trees for AI workflows |
| **SWOT Analysis** | Assess AI strategy |
| **Process Modeling (BPMN)** | Map flows with AI intervention |
| **Use Cases / User Stories** | Specify AI features |

### Evaluation
| Technique | When to use it |
|----------|-------------|
| **Acceptance & Evaluation Criteria** | Define "done" for AI features |
| **Metrics & KPIs** | Measure the business value of AI |
| **Risk Analysis** | Assess AI deployment risks |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Investigate AI incidents |

## BABOK vs Agile Extension

IIBA also published the **Agile Extension to the BABOK** (AgileBA) to fit Agile environments:

| BABOK | Agile Extension |
|-------|----------------|
| Detailed requirements upfront | Just-in-time requirements |
| Formal documentation | Lightweight artifacts |
| Sequential approach | Iterative discovery |
| Separate BA phase | BA embedded in sprints |

In modern AI projects, you usually combine both - use Agile Extension for sprint-level work while using BABOK techniques for strategic analysis.

## Applying BABOK in real AI projects

### Week 1-2: Business Analysis Planning
```
1. Identify stakeholders (Product Owner, Data Scientist, End Users, Compliance)
2. Define BA approach (Agile sprints + lightweight documentation)
3. Set up requirements tool (Jira, Confluence, or Azure DevOps)
4. Create RACI matrix cho BA activities
```

### Week 3-4: Elicitation
```
1. Workshop với business stakeholders → define problem + success criteria
2. Job shadowing với end users → understand current workflow pain points
3. Interview Data Scientist → understand technical constraints
4. Synthesize insights với AI tool → cluster themes, identify gaps
```

### Sprint by Sprint: RADD + Solution Evaluation
```
Per sprint:
- Refine user stories với acceptance criteria
- Create AI behavior specification cho new features
- Validate with stakeholders
- Measure feature adoption post-release
```

## IIBA certifications related to BABOK

| Certification | Requirement | Intended for |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **ECBA** | 21 PD, 0 experience | Entry-level BA |
| **CCBA** | 21 PD, 2 years of experience | Mid-level BA |
| **CBAP** | 35 PD, 5 years of experience | Senior BA |
| **AAC** | Agile focus | BA in Agile teams |

## Tips for studying BABOK effectively

1. **Do not read it from start to finish** - BABOK is a reference, not a novel. Read the KA you need most right now.
2. **Map it to real work** - Whenever you do a BA task, check how BABOK defines that task.
3. **Focus on Techniques** - The Techniques section of BABOK is extremely practical. Memorize the 20 most common ones first.
4. **Combine it with AI tools** - BABOK defines the WHAT, AI tools help you do the HOW faster.
5. **Study with the goal of taking ECBA/CCBA** - Exam preparation forces you to understand BABOK systematically.

## Conclusion

BABOK is not a document you read once and abandon - it is a **reference guide** you will return to many times during your BA career. Mastering the 6 Knowledge Areas and 20-30 core techniques is enough to work effectively. The rest will naturally come with real experience.

In the AI era, BABOK matters even more - because AI tools can automate many BA tasks, but **analytical thinking** and the **ability to identify the right problem** are things AI cannot replace.
