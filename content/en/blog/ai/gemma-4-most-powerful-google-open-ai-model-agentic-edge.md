On April 2, 2026, Google DeepMind officially launched **Gemma 4** — the most powerful family of open AI models they've ever released. With an **Apache 2.0** license, support for **agentic workflows**, **vision & audio**, **140+ languages**, and the ability to run directly on devices from Raspberry Pi to smartphones, Gemma 4 isn't just an upgrade — it's a complete game changer for open-source AI.

The results? The 31B model ranks **#3 globally** on the Arena AI leaderboard (open models), outperforming many models **20x larger** in parameter count. The 26B MoE model claims **#6**. And the edge E2B variant runs smoothly on phones with under **1.5GB RAM**.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis: architecture, capabilities, benchmarks, ecosystem, and how you can start using Gemma 4 today.

* * *

## 1. What Is Gemma 4?

Gemma 4 is a family of large language models (LLMs) from Google DeepMind, built on the same technology and research as **Gemini 3** — but designed to run on **your hardware**.

Since its first generation, Gemma has been downloaded over **400 million times**, creating the **Gemmaverse** ecosystem with more than **100,000 community-contributed variants**. Gemma 4 is the biggest leap forward in this product line.

### Design Philosophy

Gemma 4 doesn't chase models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Instead, Google focuses on **intelligence-per-parameter** — maximum intelligence per parameter. The goal: achieve frontier-level capability with significantly lower hardware requirements.

* * *

## 2. Four Sizes, Four Use Cases

Google releases Gemma 4 in **4 variants** designed for different hardware segments:

| Model | Architecture | Context Window | Target Hardware | Key Features |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **E2B** (Effective 2B) | Compact | 128K | Smartphone, IoT, Raspberry Pi | Audio + Vision, <1.5GB RAM |
| **E4B** (Effective 4B) | Compact | 128K | Smartphone, tablet | Multimodal, agentic on-device |
| **26B MoE** | Mixture of Experts | 256K | Consumer GPU, workstation | Only activates 3.8B params → high speed |
| **31B Dense** | Dense | 256K | GPU H100 80GB (bfloat16) | Maximum quality, fine-tuning foundation |

### 2.1. E2B and E4B — AI on Every Device

These two edge models are designed **from the ground up** for maximum computational efficiency and memory use. They only activate an effective footprint of 2B and 4B parameters during inference, saving RAM and battery.

Key features:
- **Native audio input**: Voice recognition and audio understanding directly on device
- **Native vision**: Processing video and images at multiple resolutions, OCR, chart understanding
- **Runs fully offline** on Raspberry Pi 5, NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, Qualcomm, MediaTek
- Integrates with **Android AICore Developer Preview** — forward-compatible with Gemini Nano 4

Impressive metrics on Raspberry Pi 5 with LiteRT-LM:
- **Prefill**: 133 tokens/second
- **Decode**: 7.6 tokens/second
- Fast enough for smart home controllers, voice assistants, and offline robotics

### 2.2. 26B MoE — Frontier Speed on Consumer Hardware

A Mixture of Experts model with 26B total parameters but only **activating 3.8B** per inference. Result: astonishing tokens-per-second speed while still achieving frontier quality.

- **#6** on the Arena AI leaderboard (open models)
- Quantized version runs on consumer GPUs
- Ideal for IDEs, coding assistants, and agentic workflows requiring low latency

### 2.3. 31B Dense — Maximum Quality

A traditional dense model, optimized for raw quality and the strongest foundation for fine-tuning.

- **#3 globally** on the Arena AI text leaderboard (open models)
- Outperforms models 20x larger in parameter count
- bfloat16 weights fit on a single NVIDIA H100 80GB GPU
- Quantized version runs on consumer GPUs

## 3. Standout Capabilities

### 3.1. Agentic Workflow — Not Just a Chatbot

This is Gemma 4's biggest leap over the previous generation. The model supports natively:

- **Function calling**: Directly calling tools and APIs
- **Structured JSON output**: Structured, reliable output for production
- **Native system instructions**: System guidance at the native level
- **Multi-step planning**: Planning and executing multi-step workflows

This means you can build **autonomous agents** running entirely on-device, without internet, without sending data to the cloud.

### 3.2. Vision & Audio

All Gemma 4 models natively process **video and images**:
- Variable resolution support
- High-quality OCR
- Chart and graph understanding
- E2B/E4B also supports **native audio input** for speech recognition

### 3.3. Code Generation

Gemma 4 supports high-quality offline code generation, turning your workstation into a **local-first AI code assistant**. Combined with 26B MoE (high speed) or 31B Dense (maximum quality), you get a coding assistant experience independent of the cloud.

### 3.4. 140+ Languages

Natively trained on more than 140 languages — including Vietnamese. This is a major advantage for developers building applications serving multilingual and global markets.

### 3.5. Extended Context Window

- **Edge models** (E2B, E4B): 128K tokens
- **Larger models** (26B, 31B): 256K tokens

Sufficient to pass an entire code repository or long document in a single prompt.

## 4. Agent Skills on Edge — The Future of On-Device AI

Google simultaneously launched **Agent Skills** in the [Google AI Edge Gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery) app — one of the first applications to run **multi-step, autonomous, fully on-device agentic workflows**.

### What Can Gemma 4 on Edge Do?

**1. Expand knowledge base:**
Agents can access information beyond their training data. Example: create a Wikipedia query skill to answer any encyclopedia question.

**2. Create interactive content:**
Transform text or video into summaries, flashcards, and interactive charts. Example: automatically summarize and display daily sleep/mood trends from user voice input.

**3. Extend core capabilities:**
Integrate with other models like text-to-speech, image generation, and music synthesis. Example: pair photos with mood-appropriate music.

**4. End-to-end experiences:**
Instead of switching between multiple apps, users manage complex workflows entirely through conversation. Google demonstrated an app that describes and plays animal sounds — built entirely through conversation.

### LiteRT-LM — Runtime for On-Device

[LiteRT-LM](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert-lm/overview) is a new runtime enabling Gemma 4 deployment on any device:

- **Minimal memory**: Gemma 4 E2B runs with <1.5GB memory thanks to 2-bit and 4-bit weight support
- **Constrained decoding**: Structured output, ensuring reliable tool-calling in production
- **Dynamic context**: Flexible processing on CPU and GPU with dynamic context length, maximizing the 128K context window
- **Performance**: Processes 4,000 input tokens across 2 separate skills in under 3 seconds

Multi-platform support:

| Platform | Support |
|----------|--------|
| **Mobile** | Android (CPU/GPU), iOS, Android AICore |
| **Desktop & Web** | Windows, Linux, macOS (Metal), WebGPU |
| **IoT & Robotics** | Raspberry Pi 5, Qualcomm IQ8 NPU |

Google also launched a **Python package and CLI tool** `litert-lm` for Linux, macOS, and Raspberry Pi — allowing experimentation with Gemma 4 directly from the terminal without writing code:

```bash
# Install litert-lm CLI
pip install litert-lm

# Run Gemma 4 E2B directly from terminal
litert-lm run gemma-4-e2b
```

* * *

## 5. Apache 2.0 — A Licensing Milestone

This is the biggest strategic change. Previous Gemma versions used the **Gemma Terms of Use** — a custom license with certain restrictions. Gemma 4 switches entirely to **Apache 2.0**.

This means:

- **Commercial freedom**: Unlimited use, modification, and distribution
- **Digital sovereignty**: Full control over data, infrastructure, and models
- **No restrictions**: Deploy freely, on-premises or cloud, without reporting or registration

Clément Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, commented: *"The release of Gemma 4 under the Apache 2.0 license is an important milestone."*

### License Comparison with Other Open Models

| Model | License | Commercial | Derivative Works |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Gemma 4** | Apache 2.0 | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| Llama 3.x | Llama License | ✅ (conditional >700M MAU) | ✅ With restrictions |
| Mistral | Apache 2.0 | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |
| Qwen 2.5 | Apache 2.0 / Tongyi | ✅ Variant-dependent | ✅ Variant-dependent |

Gemma 4 places Google on par with Mistral in terms of openness — and far ahead of Meta (Llama) in licensing freedom.
