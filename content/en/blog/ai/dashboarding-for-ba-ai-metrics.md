BA doesn't need to be a data analyst to build a dashboard. With Looker Studio or Power BI, if you know what data to track and why, you can create a useful dashboard in a few hours.

## 1. Metric Framework for an AI Feature Dashboard

BA needs 3 layers of metrics:

### Layer 1: Business Outcome Metrics
"Is the AI feature delivering value to the business?"

| Metric | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Automation rate** | % of requests AI handles autonomously | "AI self-resolved 73% of tickets" |
| **Time saved** | Time saved vs manual process | "Reduced by 4.2 min/ticket" |
| **Error rate post-AI** | Error rate after AI was introduced | "Dropped from 12% to 3.5%" |
| **Cost per outcome** | AI cost vs manual cost | "$0.03/ticket vs $1.20 manual" |

### Layer 2: AI Quality Metrics
"Is the AI working correctly?"

| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy (rolling 7d)** | % of correct predictions | < 85% |
| **Human override rate** | % of cases where agent had to override AI | > 25% |
| **Confidence distribution** | Histogram of confidence scores | Shift > 10% |
| **Latency P95** | 95th percentile response time | > 3 seconds |

### Layer 3: Operational Metrics
"Is the system stable?"

| Metric | Description | Alert |
|---|---|---|
| **API error rate** | % of requests returning errors | > 1% |
| **Queue depth** | Number of cases awaiting human review | > SLA capacity |
| **Throughput** | Requests/hour | Drop > 50% from baseline |

## 2. Dashboard Design for Different Stakeholders

### 2.1 Executive Dashboard (Monthly Review)

**Audience:** C-level, Directors  
**Purpose:** ROI and business impact  
**Keep it to:** 4–5 numbers + 1–2 trend charts

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AI Feature Health Dashboard — [Month YYYY]         │
├─────────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬────────────┤
│  Cases      │  AI Auto    │  Time      │  Cost      │
│  Processed  │  Handled    │  Saved     │  Saved     │
│  12,450     │  73%        │  847 hours │  $34,200   │
│  (+8% MoM)  │  (+3% MoM)  │            │  vs manual │
├─────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴────────────┤
│  [Trend Chart: Automation Rate over 6 months]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Operations Dashboard (Daily Monitoring)

**Audience:** BA + Ops team  
**Purpose:** Detect issues early  
**Include:** Real-time metrics, alerts

Key widgets:
- Live accuracy (rolling 24h)
- Human override rate today vs last week
- Queue depth + SLA breach count
- Error rate + latency

### 2.3 Sprint Review Dashboard

**Audience:** Dev team + PM  
**Purpose:** Sprint progress  
**Include:** Stories done vs planned, bugs found, AC coverage

## 3. Tool Comparison

| Tool | Strengths | Limitations | BA Fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Looker Studio** (Google) | Free, easy Google Sheets integration | Limited visuals | ✅ Great for quick setup |
| **Power BI** | Powerful, Office 365 integration | Paid, steeper learning curve | ✅ Great for enterprise |
| **Metabase** | SQL-friendly, self-hosted option | Requires DB access | ⚠️ Need tech help for setup |
| **Tableau** | Best visuals | Expensive | ❌ Overkill for BA |
| **Grafana** | Ops/ML monitoring | Too technical | ❌ Not for BA |

---

## 4. Step-by-step: Looker Studio for BA

### Step 1: Identify your data source
Ask Dev to export logs to Google Sheets or BigQuery:
```
Columns needed:
- timestamp
- request_id
- ai_prediction
- confidence_score
- human_override (true/false)
- override_reason
- resolution_time_seconds
```

### Step 2: Connect the data source
Looker Studio → Add data → Google Sheets (or BigQuery)

### Step 3: Create the necessary charts

```
Chart 1: Scorecard — "Automation Rate"
  Metric: COUNT(WHERE human_override = false) / COUNT(*) × 100

Chart 2: Time Series — "Daily Accuracy (7-day rolling)"
  Dimension: Date
  Metric: % correct predictions

Chart 3: Bar Chart — "Top Override Reasons"
  Dimension: override_reason
  Metric: COUNT(*)

Chart 4: Gauge — "Today's Override Rate"
  Reference line: target threshold
```

### Step 4: Set up automated refresh
In Google Sheets: Tools → Apps Script → setTrigger(daily refresh from DB)

---

## 5. Dashboard Governance

BA needs to establish:

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Who maintains the dashboard? (usually the BA) |
| **Refresh rate** | Daily/hourly/realtime depending on the metric |
| **Distribution** | Who receives the email summary? (weekly) |
| **Review cadence** | Metric definition review every quarter |
| **Alert routing** | When an alert fires, who receives it and what do they do? |

---

## Conclusion

A dashboard isn't data analyst work — it's a **BA communication tool**. The goal isn't beauty or complexity; it's **the right metrics, the right audience, the right frequency**. A dashboard with 5 charts that is checked every day is worth more than a 20-chart dashboard that nobody opens.
