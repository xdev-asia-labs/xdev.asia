## 3. Core Improvements

### 3.1 Vision Resolution More Than 3× Higher

<img src="/images/blog/claude-opus-4-7-vision-upgrade.png" alt="Claude Opus 4.7 vision upgrade — 3x higher resolution" style="width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:16px 0" />

This is one of the most significant upgrades. Opus 4.7 can process images up to **2,576 pixels on the long edge** (~3.75 megapixels) — **more than 3 times** previous Claude models.

This unlocks a range of new use cases:
- **Computer-use agents** reading information-dense screenshots
- **Data extraction** from complex technical charts
- **Life sciences** — reading chemical structures, engineering diagrams, patent files
- **Work requiring pixel-perfect reference**

> **Note:** This is a model-level change, not an API parameter. Images sent to the model will be processed at higher resolution, meaning more tokens consumed. If high detail isn't needed, you can downsample images before sending.

### 3.2 Superior Instruction Following

Opus 4.7 **significantly improves** instruction adherence. Anthropic warns this is a **two-directional** change:

- **Good:** The model follows instructions more precisely, without skipping or loosely interpreting them
- **Worth noting:** Prompts written for Opus 4.6 may produce unexpected results since Opus 4.7 interprets more literally

→ **Recommendation:** Re-tune prompts and harnesses when migrating to 4.7.

### 3.3 Better Long-Term Memory

Opus 4.7 uses **file system-based memory** more effectively. The model can:
- Remember important notes across multiple long sessions
- Use memory to continue new tasks without re-providing full context

This is an important improvement for multi-day agentic workflows.

### 3.4 New Effort Level: `xhigh`

<img src="/images/blog/claude-opus-4-7-effort-levels.png" alt="Claude Opus 4.7 effort levels — xhigh extra high" style="width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:16px 0" />

Opus 4.7 introduces the **`xhigh`** (extra high) effort level — sitting between `high` and `max`. This allows finer control over the balance between:
- Reasoning depth
- Latency
- Token cost

In **Claude Code**, Anthropic has raised the default effort level to `xhigh` for all plans. The recommendation is to start with `high` or `xhigh` when testing Opus 4.7 for coding and agentic use cases.

## 5. Safety & Alignment

<img src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/3a5b5c3eedb539fe20bc8dd1ecfc952c447000b8-1920x1080.png" alt="Safety profile of Claude Opus 4.7" style="width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:16px 0" />

Opus 4.7 has a **safety profile similar to Opus 4.6**:

**Improvements over 4.6:**
- Honesty (more truthful)
- Resistance to prompt injection attacks

**Minor weaknesses:**
- Occasionally provides overly detailed harm-reduction advice about controlled substances

Anthropic concludes the model is *"largely well-aligned and trustworthy, though not fully ideal in its behavior."* **Mythos Preview** remains the best-aligned model by Anthropic's own assessment.

### Cybersecurity Safeguards

Opus 4.7 is the **first model** equipped with automated safeguards to detect and block requests related to prohibited or high-risk cybersecurity activities. Anthropic explains this is groundwork for the eventual wider release of Mythos-class models.

Security professionals who want to use Opus 4.7 for legitimate cybersecurity work (vulnerability research, pen testing, red-teaming) can apply to the **[Cyber Verification Program](https://claude.com/form/cyber-use-case)**.

## 6. New Accompanying Features

### 6.1 Task Budgets (Public Beta)

A new feature on the Claude Platform (API): developers can **guide Claude's token spend** so the model prioritizes work across longer runs. Useful for agentic workflows that need cost control.

### 6.2 `/ultrareview` in Claude Code

A new slash command that creates a **dedicated review session** that reads through all code changes and flags bugs and design issues a thorough reviewer would catch.

- Pro and Max users get **3 free ultrareviews** to try
- Anthropic has raised the default effort to `xhigh` for Claude Code on all plans

### 6.3 Auto Mode for Max Users

**Auto mode** is a new permissions option: Claude makes decisions on your behalf, allowing longer tasks to run with fewer interruptions and less risk of skipping permissions.

## 8. Migrating from Opus 4.6: What You Need to Know

<img src="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/images/4zrzovbb/website/ff97ab0f2a5f3a243da02398f97dec1ac99b526a-3840x2160.png" alt="Token usage at each effort level — Opus 4.7 vs 4.6" style="width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:16px 0" />

Opus 4.7 is a **direct upgrade** of Opus 4.6, but there are **two token usage changes** to plan for:

### 8.1 New Tokenizer

Opus 4.7 uses an improved tokenizer that processes text more efficiently. The trade-off: **the same input may map to more tokens** — approximately **1.0–1.35×** depending on content type.

### 8.2 More Thinking at High Effort

Opus 4.7 "thinks" more at high effort levels, especially in later turns within agentic settings. This improves reliability but produces more output tokens.

### How to Control Token Usage

- Use the **effort parameter** (drop to `medium` or `low` if top accuracy isn't needed)
- Adjust **task budgets**
- Prompt the model more explicitly for **conciseness**

> **Practical result:** In internal coding evaluations, total token usage across all effort levels has **improved** compared to Opus 4.6. But Anthropic recommends measuring on your actual traffic.
