excerpt: >-
  When AI participates in business processes, traditional UML/BPMN diagrams lack ways to represent AI actors, fallback paths, and human-in-the-loop. This guide teaches BA to diagram AI-assisted flows correctly — with happy path, error path, confidence threshold, and escalation to human.

When you diagram an AI-assisted feature, you'll encounter questions that traditional UML/BPMN don't answer: **Is AI an actor or service? Where does the flow go when AI isn't confident? Who handles when AI gets it wrong?**

This guide addresses exactly those issues.

---

## 1. Why Traditional BPMN Falls Short for AI

BPMN 2.0 has the basics: Pool, Lane, Task, Gateway, Event. But AI introduces 3 elements that old diagrams can't capture:

1. **Probabilistic output** — AI doesn't return true/false but returns *confidence score*
2. **Fallback / escalation** — When AI isn't confident enough, there's an alternative path
3. **Human-in-the-loop** — Humans intervene at specific points, not the entire flow

---

## 2. Extended Notation for AI in BPMN

No need to create new symbols — use standard BPMN with annotations:

| Element | Used For | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Service Task** (gear icon) | AI service call | Label: "AI: [model/service name]" |
| **Exclusive Gateway (X)** | Branch by confidence | Label: "confidence ≥ threshold?" |
| **Intermediate Boundary Event** | AI timeout / error | Type: Error or Timer |
| **User Task** | Human review/override | Lane: Agent / Reviewer |
| **Data Object** | Confidence score, AI response | Annotate with threshold value |
| **Text Annotation** | Note threshold, SLA | Example: "threshold = 0.75" |

---

## 3. Pattern: AI with Confidence Threshold

This is the most common pattern when BA designs AI features:

```
[User Input]
    ↓
[AI Service Task]
    ↓
{Confidence ≥ 0.8?}
    ├── Yes → [Auto Process] → [Notify User] → END
    └── No  → [Queue to Human Review]
                   ↓
              [Agent Reviews]
                   ↓
              {Agent Decision}
                   ├── Approve → [Process] → [Notify User] → END
                   └── Reject  → [Notify Rejection] → END
```

**Key points when diagramming:**
- Threshold must be explicit (0.8 not "high confidence")
- Human review lane must be clear — who? (Agent? Supervisor? Domain expert?)
- SLA for human task must be visible (e.g., "max 4 business hours")

---

## 4. Pattern: Human-in-the-Loop Escalation

When AI fails or encounters out-of-distribution cases:

```
[User Request]
    ↓
[AI Classifier]
    ↓
{Case type?}
    ├── Standard → [AI Auto-Handle]
    ├── Complex  → [AI Draft + Human Review]
    └── Unknown  → [Escalate to Senior Agent]
                         ↓
                   [Agent Handles]
                         ↓
                   [Log to Training Data]  ← Important feedback loop!
```

**BA must capture:**
- What defines "Standard / Complex / Unknown" specifically
- Who is "Senior Agent"? Any SLA?
- Training data log: who approves before adding to feedback loop?

---

## 5. Use Case Diagram for AI Features

Use Case Diagram clarifies *what each actor does* with the AI system. Actors:

- **End User**: Primary interaction
- **AI System**: Non-human actor
- **Human Agent**: Handles escalations
- **Admin / Data Steward**: Configures thresholds, reviews training data
- **External System**: APIs, database, knowledge base

Example for AI chatbot customer service:

```
[End User]     ──→ Submit question
[AI System]    ──→ Process question
               ──→ Provide answer
               ──→ Escalate to agent
[Human Agent]  ──→ Receive escalation
               ──→ Override AI response
[Admin]        ──→ Configure confidence threshold
               ──→ Review performance metrics
               ──→ Approve training data
```

## 6. Sequence Diagram for AI Interaction

Sequence diagrams show call order between systems — very useful with engineering:

```
User          Frontend     AI Gateway    LLM Service   Database
 |                |              |              |           |
 |—— submit ———→  |              |              |           |
 |                |—— request ——→|              |           |
 |                |              |—— prompt ——→ |           |
 |                |              |              |—— RAG ——→ |
 |                |              |              |←— docs ——  |
 |                |              |←—response——  |           |
 |                |              | (score:0.85) |           |
 |                |←—— result ——  |              |           |
 |←— display ——   |              |              |           |
```

**Points BA must watch when reviewing:**
- Timeout at which step? How handled when LLM is slow?
- RAG retrieval fails → AI has fallback?
- Response goes through content filter?
- Where is audit log written?

## 7. Checklist for Diagramming AI-Assisted Flows

```
BEFORE DRAWING
☐ Define: Is AI automatic or recommend-only?
☐ Define confidence threshold (specific number)
☐ Define escalation path and owner

WHILE DRAWING
☐ AI service task clearly labeled with model/service
☐ Confidence gateway has threshold annotation
☐ Human-in-the-loop has separate lane with SLA
☐ Error path (AI timeout/fail) drawn explicitly, not omitted
☐ Audit/log step drawn (not implicit understanding)

AFTER DRAWING
☐ Dev confirms sequence diagram reflects architecture accurately
☐ Business confirms happy path follows business logic
☐ QA confirms can test each branch
☐ Compliance confirms audit logging is sufficient
```

## 8. Recommended Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Lucidchart** | Complete BPMN + UML | Has AI workflow templates |
| **draw.io / diagrams.net** | Free, offline, all diagrams | Export XML, Confluence integration |
| **Miro** | Workshop with stakeholders | Easy real-time collaboration |
| **PlantUML** | Sequence diagrams as code | Good for version control |
| **Figma** | Wireframe + user flow | Works well with UI design |

## Summary

BA doesn't need to understand AI algorithms, but **must diagram AI flows accurately enough so that**:
- Engineering builds correctly
- QA tests all branches (including AI failure paths)
- Business understands when AI handles automatically vs. when human intervenes
