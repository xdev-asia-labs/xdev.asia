"Should we use OMOP, FHIR, or i2b2?" — every organization starting its healthcare data journey asks this. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. This article helps you pick the right tool for the right use case.

## 1. Map of healthcare CDMs

## 2. Comparison table

| Criterion | OMOP | FHIR | i2b2 | PCORnet | Sentinel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Owner | OHDSI (open) | HL7 (open) | Harvard (open) | PCORI (US) | FDA (US) |
| Year | 2008 | 2014 | 2007 | 2014 | 2008 |
| Primary goal | Multi-source RWE | Operational exchange | Self-service queries | Pragmatic trials | Drug safety |
| Schema | 37 relational tables | Resource (REST) | Star schema (fact + dim) | Flat tabular | Flat tabular |
| Vocabulary | Standard Concepts (normalized) | CodeableConcept (flexible) | Local | Local + standard | Local |
| Open tooling | ATLAS, HADES, DQD, ACHILLES | HAPI, Cerner SMART | i2b2 web client | Build-your-own | Closed |
| Real-time | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Federated network | ✅ EHDEN, DARWIN, OHDSI | ⚠ via Bulk Export | ✅ SHRINE | ✅ DRN | ✅ |
| Best for | Observational analytics | EHR / mobile / cloud | Hospital queries | Pragmatic RCTs | Pharmacovigilance |
| Adoption (2026) | 800M patients | Industry-wide | ~200 sites | ~70 sites | FDA-internal |
| Vietnam community | Just starting | Growing fast | Limited | None | None |

## 3. Core differences

### 3.1 Schema philosophy

![Schema philosophy](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-vs-fhir-vs-i2b2-pcornet-d02.png)

OMOP = a normalized relational DB → optimized for SQL analytics.
FHIR = document-oriented Resources → optimized for API exchange.

### 3.2 Vocabulary

OMOP **requires** every code to be mapped to a Standard Concept (e.g. ICD-10 → SNOMED). FHIR **does not require** this — you can keep local code systems if you stay internally consistent.

→ OMOP is more expensive at the ETL stage, but it pays off with much stronger analytics.

### 3.3 Federated vs. centralized

OMOP lets you run a study without moving data: the R study package runs locally at each partner and only aggregate results are shared. This fits Vietnam very well given **the Personal Data Protection Law 2025** (effective 2026-01-01, replacing Decree 13/2023/NĐ-CP), which requires sensitive data to be stored in-country and demands explicit consent for each new processing purpose.

## 4. Decision tree

## 5. Hybrid pattern: FHIR + OMOP

This is the most common 2026 pattern:

![Hybrid pattern: FHIR + OMOP](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-vs-fhir-vs-i2b2-pcornet-d05.png)

→ Operational EHRs use FHIR (real-time, web/mobile-friendly), while the research data lake uses OMOP (federated analytics). Read the [FHIR ↔ OMOP bridge article](/blog/omop-fhir-mapping-bridge).

## 6. Why OMOP wins for RWE

![Why OMOP wins for RWE](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-vs-fhir-vs-i2b2-pcornet-d06.png)

For comparison: i2b2 has a smaller community and fewer updates; PCORnet is more US-centric; Sentinel is FDA-only; CDISC is for trial submissions.

## 7. When NOT to choose OMOP

- You only need **real-time EHR exchange** → FHIR is enough
- The **dataset is tiny** (a few hundred patients) → direct SQL queries are simpler
- You are **submitting a new drug to the FDA** → SDTM is mandatory
- US **pharmacovigilance** → Sentinel
- The organization **has no data engineers** → OMOP ETL is a non-trivial investment

## 8. Recommendations for Vietnam

| Organization | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Large public hospital | FHIR (operational) + OMOP (research data warehouse) |
| Private hospital | FHIR is enough at first; add OMOP when starting RWE work |
| Research institute | OMOP as the centerpiece, ETL from multiple partner hospitals |
| BHYT / regulators | OMOP for the national data lake, FHIR to exchange with hospitals |
| Healthcare AI startup | FHIR + OMOP — FHIR for integration, OMOP for training data |

## 9. Migration between CDMs

You can migrate from:
- **i2b2 → OMOP**: Georgia Tech's i2b2-to-OMOP tool
- **PCORnet → OMOP**: ETL maintained by Duke
- **FHIR → OMOP**: FHIR-OMOP-on-FHIR (HL7 + OHDSI)
- **Sentinel → OMOP**: when you need deeper analytics

OMOP is usually the final destination because the tooling ecosystem is the richest.

## 10. Community resources

- **OHDSI Forum** — answers within 24 hours
- **Book of OHDSI** — free textbook
- **EHDEN Academy** — free courses
- **OHDSI Symposium** — annual, with a virtual track
- **Working groups** — Vocabulary, Themis (ETL conventions), AI/ML, Vietnam (none yet — waiting for someone to launch it!)

## Conclusion

CDMs are not zero-sum. Most organizations in 2026 use FHIR + OMOP side by side: FHIR for operations, OMOP for analytics. If you are in Vietnam and want to do RWE, train clinical AI, or run public-health research — OMOP is a worthwhile investment.
