You can skip this section and still build OMOP — but your analytics will always be wrong. Vocabulary is what **makes OMOP meaningful**. This article is a deep dive into Concepts, hierarchies, mappings, and the Athena workflow.

## 1. Why vocabulary matters

A real-world example: you have three data sources:
- Hospital A: diagnosis code "ICD-10 E11.9"
- Hospital B: code "ICD-10 E11"
- Hospital C: SNOMED code "44054006"

All three describe **type 2 diabetes**. Without standardization, "total number of type 2 diabetes patients" returns the wrong answer.

OMOP solves this by **picking one Standard Concept** (here `concept_id = 201826`, SNOMED `44054006`) and mapping every source code to it.

## 2. Concept — the basic unit

A Concept is one row in the `CONCEPT` table:

| concept_id | concept_name | domain_id | vocabulary_id | concept_class_id | standard_concept | concept_code |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 201826 | Type 2 diabetes mellitus | Condition | SNOMED | Clinical Finding | S | 44054006 |
| 192279 | Diabetic complication | Condition | SNOMED | Clinical Finding | C | 74627003 |
| 45757466 | E11 (ICD-10-CM) | Condition | ICD10CM | ICD10CM code | (null = Source) | E11 |

`standard_concept`:
- **S** (Standard): use this for analytics
- **C** (Classification): for classification, not a standard concept
- **NULL** (Source): the original code, used for source_value

## 3. Vocabulary and Domain

![Vocabulary and Domain](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-standardized-vocabularies-athena-d01.png)

| Domain | OMOP table | Primary Standard Vocabulary |
|---|---|---|
| Condition | CONDITION_OCCURRENCE | SNOMED CT |
| Drug | DRUG_EXPOSURE | RxNorm + RxNorm Extension |
| Procedure | PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE | SNOMED CT, CPT4, ICD-10-PCS |
| Measurement | MEASUREMENT | LOINC, SNOMED CT |
| Observation | OBSERVATION | SNOMED CT, LOINC |
| Device | DEVICE_EXPOSURE | SNOMED CT |
| Unit | (across) | UCUM |
| Race / Ethnicity | PERSON | OMOP Custom (needs custom mapping for Vietnam) |

## 4. Concept Relationship

The `CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP` table stores relationships between concepts:

| concept_id_1 | concept_id_2 | relationship_id |
|---|---|---|
| 45757466 (ICD10 E11) | 201826 (SNOMED Diabetes T2) | "Maps to" |
| 201826 | 45757466 | "Mapped from" |
| 1503297 (Metformin) | 1503328 (Metformin 500mg tablet) | "Has form" |

`Maps to` is critical — it is how source codes are mapped to standard concepts:

```sql
-- Find the Standard Concept that ICD-10 E11 maps to
SELECT c2.concept_id, c2.concept_name
FROM concept c1
JOIN concept_relationship cr ON c1.concept_id = cr.concept_id_1 
  AND cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to'
JOIN concept c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD10CM' AND c1.concept_code = 'E11';
```

## 5. Concept Ancestor — the hierarchy

`CONCEPT_ANCESTOR` stores the descendant hierarchy:

```sql
-- Find every descendant of "Diabetes mellitus" (Type 1, Type 2, gestational, ...)
SELECT c.concept_id, c.concept_name, ca.min_levels_of_separation
FROM concept_ancestor ca
JOIN concept c ON ca.descendant_concept_id = c.concept_id
WHERE ca.ancestor_concept_id = 201820  -- Diabetes mellitus
  AND c.standard_concept = 'S';
```

Extremely powerful for cohort definitions: "any patient with diabetes" only needs the ancestor 201820.

## 6. Athena — the vocabulary portal

![Athena — the vocabulary portal](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-standardized-vocabularies-athena-d02.png)

Workflow:
1. Create a free account at athena.ohdsi.org
2. Pick the vocabularies you need (SNOMED, RxNorm, LOINC, ICD10CM, ICD10, ATC, ...)
3. Some vocabularies require a **license** (SNOMED CT for Vietnam: register as a SNOMED International affiliate — free for Vietnam as a low-income member)
4. Download the zip — it contains CONCEPT.csv, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv, and so on
5. Import into your CDM database

## 7. Importing vocabularies into Postgres

```sql
-- Create the schema and tables using the CommonDataModel DDL
\i OMOPCDM_postgresql_5.4_ddl.sql

-- Import the CSVs (example)
COPY concept FROM '/path/CONCEPT.csv' DELIMITER E'\t' CSV HEADER QUOTE E'\b';
COPY concept_relationship FROM '/path/CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv' DELIMITER E'\t' CSV HEADER QUOTE E'\b';
COPY concept_ancestor FROM '/path/CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv' DELIMITER E'\t' CSV HEADER QUOTE E'\b';
-- ...

-- Create indexes
\i OMOPCDM_postgresql_5.4_indices.sql

-- Create primary keys
\i OMOPCDM_postgresql_5.4_primary_keys.sql
```

After import: ~6 million concepts (full set), ~12 GB. You can trim it down by only loading the vocabularies you need.

## 8. USAGI — the code mapping tool

USAGI helps you map source codes (Vietnamese ICD-10, Ministry of Health drug catalogue) to Standard Concepts:

![USAGI — the code mapping tool](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-standardized-vocabularies-athena-d03.png)

Workflow:
1. Provide an input CSV with `source_code, source_name` columns
2. USAGI searches with Lucene
3. The user reviews the top matches and accepts or edits them
4. Export → into the `SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP` table

## 9. Vocabularies for Vietnam

![Vocabularies for Vietnam](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-standardized-vocabularies-athena-d04.png)

### 9.1 Custom vocabularies for Vietnam

When no standard equivalent exists (e.g. Vietnam's 54 ethnic groups), create a **Custom Vocabulary** with:
- `vocabulary_id = 'VN_DANTOC'`
- `concept_id` starting at 2 billion (the OHDSI range reserved for custom concepts)
- Register it in the VOCABULARY table

```sql
INSERT INTO vocabulary VALUES
  ('VN_DANTOC', 'Vietnamese ethnic groups (54)', 'http://...', '1.0', 2000000001);

INSERT INTO concept VALUES
  (2000001001, 'Kinh', 'Race', 'VN_DANTOC', 'Race', 'S', '01', NULL, NULL);
-- ...
```

### 9.2 SNOMED CT in Vietnam

Vietnam is a **SNOMED International member** (registered in 2024 via the Ministry of Health). The affiliate license is free for in-country individuals and organizations. Register at snomed.org.

## 10. Vocabulary upgrades

Athena releases vocabularies monthly. Upgrade workflow:

![Vocabulary upgrade](/images/blog/diagrams/omop-standardized-vocabularies-athena-d05.png)

Note: `concept_id` is **stable** across versions, but `Maps to` relationships can change → you must re-run ETL to update the `*_concept_id` columns.

## 11. Common SQL patterns

### 11.1 Look up the standard concept for a source code

```sql
SELECT c2.concept_id, c2.concept_name, c2.vocabulary_id
FROM concept c1
JOIN concept_relationship cr ON c1.concept_id = cr.concept_id_1 
  AND cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to'
JOIN concept c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD10CM' 
  AND c1.concept_code = 'E11.9';
```

### 11.2 Find every descendant of an ancestor

```sql
SELECT c.concept_id, c.concept_name
FROM concept_ancestor ca
JOIN concept c ON ca.descendant_concept_id = c.concept_id
WHERE ca.ancestor_concept_id = 201820  -- Diabetes mellitus
  AND c.standard_concept = 'S';
```

### 11.3 RxNorm: find every product containing an ingredient

```sql
SELECT product.concept_id, product.concept_name
FROM concept ing
JOIN concept_ancestor ca ON ing.concept_id = ca.ancestor_concept_id
JOIN concept product ON ca.descendant_concept_id = product.concept_id
WHERE ing.concept_name = 'Metformin'
  AND ing.concept_class_id = 'Ingredient'
  AND product.concept_class_id IN ('Branded Drug', 'Clinical Drug');
```

## 12. Common pitfalls

- ❌ Forgetting to upgrade vocabularies → analytics use obsolete concepts
- ❌ Mapping source → standard incorrectly → cohorts off by thousands of patients
- ❌ Using Classification (C) concepts instead of Standard (S) for analytics
- ❌ Forgetting hierarchies → cohorts miss disease variants (e.g. "Diabetes" without Type 1.5)
- ❌ Custom `concept_id` colliding with the standard range (must use the 2-billion+ range)
- ❌ Failing to back up the vocabulary before an upgrade

## 13. Recommended workflow for a new project

1. Read the OHDSI Themis conventions
2. Download a vocabulary subset (SNOMED + ICD10CM + RxNorm + LOINC + ATC + UCUM) — covers 90% of Vietnamese needs
3. Register as a SNOMED International affiliate (free for Vietnam)
4. Import into Postgres + index
5. Set up USAGI for the mapping team
6. Map the largest source codes first (top 100 ICD-10 + top 200 drugs covers ~80% of volume)
7. Save the mapping in `SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP` and commit it to Git
8. Schedule quarterly vocabulary upgrades

## Conclusion

Vocabulary is 50% of OMOP's value. Invest correctly — and you can join and analyze any dataset. Invest poorly — and your analytics will always be in doubt. Start small, review carefully, upgrade regularly.
